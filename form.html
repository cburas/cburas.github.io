<h2> What do you Think?</h2>

<p> There are many other children's books which have been transformed into movies than just the ones in these lists. The idea was to name those books which movies became "classics" or were blockbusters. Do you think we're missing one? Do you think there is a title on this list that doesn't deserve to be here?</p>
