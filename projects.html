<h2> Past and Current Projects </h2>

<h4> Past </h4>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/cburas/recursion">Recursion </a></li> - While at DevBootcamp, I was having trouble with a particular exercise which included recursion as well as math. I was so focused on the math that I wasn't sure if my issues were with that or recursion itself. A teacher gave me two exercises involving recursion without math to replace the others. I had to set up the repository on my own, which was new for me. It's always the little things that excite you the most.
</ul>

<h4> Present </h4>
<ul> 
	<li> A database to store the results of the form using SQL</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning">The Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Hartl</a> - I never had the chance to go through it so now is as good a time as any.
</ul>
