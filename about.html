<h2> About Me</h2>
<p>I never thought in a million years I would be here, creating a website and actually knowing what I'm doing. After graduation it was obvious finding a job, let alone a career, was going to be difficult. My aunt suggested I learn Ruby because the skill was covetted by employers and those who had it earned a lot of money. But I wasn't interested in a lot of money, I wanted to be an author and thus wanted to insert myself into the publishing industry. I figured the more I knew about the business, the more I would understand what it takes to be an author behind the scenes.</p>

<p>Alas, my lifelong dream of becoming an author had died years earlier and it was a couple years into my job at a book publishing company that I realized it. I was carrying a dream because it was old and the first one I had, not because it was actually my dream anymore. It was about this time a friend suggested I consider learning Ruby because he believed I might enjoy it. This time I listened and started taking the free course on <a href="www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>. I was soon hooked and decided I wanted to pursue a career using it.</p>

<p>This website started as an assignment from DevBootCamp, a school creating new programmers. I spent a year going to workshops, learning on my own, trying to get accepted into DevBootcamp. It was an incredible experience and I'm grateful for what I learned. Sadly, it turned out not to be the place for me so I'm on my own once again. I'm back on the workshop hunt and searching for other opportunities to improve my developing skills (an apprenticeship maybe?? We'll see!)</p>
