<p> Today it seems as if every movie isn't based off a screenplay but a book. When we were children, the trend was the same but we were far less aware of it. That's why it's so surprising when we learn a story we have only categorized as a movie turns out to be based on a novel.</p>
<p> This site names and describes those novels, some well known, some not. The titles are categorized into two sections: Classic and Modern. In this instance, classic titles are considered anything published before 1922 and modern titles are anything since then. The date 1922 was chosen as this is the current cut-off date for works in the public domain until January 1, 2019.</p>

	I used this site to help with my page structures.</p>

	I like this website because it offers a picture of the book/movie next to each title. I think this makes it a lot easier to identify the title. I also like that it's in a format in which I can see the list all at once. Another site has the list in a slideshow format. I don't like this because I had to change page/photo to look up a forgotten book.</p>
