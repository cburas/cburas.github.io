	<h2> Children's Stories </h2>
	<h3> The movies and the books that inspired them </h3>
	<p> When I found out there was a book from way back when about Winnie the Pooh, Mary Poppins, Peter Pan and the like, I wanted to read the original stories. So this page will have information about the book and the movie of some children's stories.
